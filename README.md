- Uninstall the bloatware by selecting the apps and clicking on the uninstall button
*However, you should not delete all of the apps listed below. Some apps are required for your phone to function, and removing them may result in your phone failing to boot into the Android operating system (if this happens you need to wipe your phone to get it working again this means losing all your personal data).*

*Select the apps you’d like to remove and click the uninstall button at the bottom. You can reinstall apps with the “reinstaller” menu if you unintentionally delete an app you don’t want to delete.*
